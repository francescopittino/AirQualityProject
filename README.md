# AirQualitySensorTesting
A collection of scripts to test some air quality sensors I used to create an air quality station.
All Sensors have been tested separately using PlatformIO, an extension of Visual Studio Code.
To import the project head over to the PlatformIO home page on VSCode and use the "Import Project" function
The "platformio.ini" file contains the details of the project including the libraries used, PlatformIO should take care of those on its own.
