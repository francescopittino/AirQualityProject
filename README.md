# AirQualityProject
A collection of scripts and basically everthing i used to test some air quality sensors and create an air quality monitoring station.
All Sensors have been tested separately using PlatformIO, an extension of Visual Studio Code.
To import the project head over to the PlatformIO home page on VSCode and use the "Import Project" function
The "platformio.ini" file contains the details of the project including the libraries used, PlatformIO should take care of those on its own.

The libraries contained in the platformio.ini file might not actually be used. They are however included because this repository has been used in a university project so the libraries, even unused, are still present in the file because of developments in the project. IE: an interesting library that at first appeared useful but later on has been deemed unnecessary. This might change later on.
